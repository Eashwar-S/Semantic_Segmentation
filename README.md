# Semantic_Segmentation

In this project, semantic segmentation is done using U-net. U-net is popularly used convolutional neural net for semantic segmentaation.

## Dataset used for Training and Testing:
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com. The datasets used can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/data).

## U-net:
The following is the architecture of U-net used to perform Semantic Segmentation.
